#Weather-Tracker-C6

When approaching this challenge I was curious on how to go forward with it. I had seen examples of highly detailed html pages, and others which were more JS heavy. I decided to go a more simplistic route and make it look as though it can be something that can be updated quickly and easy to read.

This application is designed to be used quickly and accurately, giving the average temperature for the city you are searching for with accurate data. Utilizing OpenWeatherMaps API I was able to fetch the information and give an accurate response for the users.

Going forward I would like to update the UI and add new features, such as images or logos to make it more easy to read to users. I would also like to add other details such as rain or cloudy reports.

The deployed page is featured at [ ].
